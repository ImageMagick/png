Changes since the last public release (1.6.32):
Version 1.6.33beta01 [August 28, 2017]
  Added PNGMINUS_UNUSED macro to contrib/pngminus/p*.c and added missing
    parenthesis in contrib/pngminus/pnm2png.c (bug report by Christian Hesse).
  Fixed off-by-one error in png_do_check_palette_indexes() (Bug report
    by Mick P., Source Forge Issue #269).

Version 1.6.33beta02 [September 3, 2017]
  Initialize png_handler.row_ptr in contrib/oss-fuzz/libpng_read_fuzzer.cc
    to fix shortlived oss-fuzz issue 3234.
  Compute a larger limit on IDAT because some applications write a deflate
    buffer for each row (Bug report by Andrew Church).
  Use current date (DATE) instead of release-date (RDATE) in last
    changed date of contrib/oss-fuzz files.
  Enabled ARM support in CMakeLists.txt (Bernd Kuhls).
